# eleMemory
*A simple memory game for elementary OS*

This app is a learning project for me on how to create apps for elementary OS using Vala and Gtk. Nevertheless, it would be great if it would become mature enough to be interesting for people to install and have fun with.

I will keep the app rather simple, but I'm planing to include the following features (not necessarily in that order):
* Highscore (using sqlite3 database?...)
* 3 levels of difficulty (i.e. 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8 tile arrangements)
* Option to change motif schemes of the tiles
* Single player and 1 vs. 1
* When the app is opened, it continues the game from before (save game state upon closing the app)
